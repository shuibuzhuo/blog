当我们请求一个接口的时候，很多情况下，我们会直接得到一个 json 数据：

```js
{
  "userId": 1,
  "id": 1,
  "title": "delectus aut autem",
  "completed": false
}
```

但有时候，当我们请求一个图片的时候，接口可能直接给我们返回一个二进制的数据：

## 解决方法1：将二进制数据转化为 blob
```js
{
  // `responseType` indicates the type of data that the server will respond with
  // options are: 'arraybuffer', 'document', 'json', 'text', 'stream'
  //   browser only: 'blob'
  responseType: 'blob'
}
```

这个时候，响应会变成一个 blob 对象：

![](./blob.png)

此时，我们便可以将它转换为 url：
```js
// js
const srcValue = URL.createObjectURL(res.data);

// html
<img :src="srcValue" />
```

最终效果：

![](./blob-img.png)

![](./pic.png)

## 解决方法2：将二进制数据转化为 arrayBuffer
这个时候，我们需要将 responseType 设置为 arrayBuffer，比如 axios 里可以[这样](https://github.com/axios/axios#request-config)配置：
```js
{
  responseType: 'arraybuffer'
}
```

这个时候，响应会变成一个 arrayBuffer 对象：

![](./array-buffer.png)

此时，我们便可以将它转换为 base64 字符串：
```js
const base64ImageString = Buffer.from(res.data, 'binary').toString('base64')
```

最后，我们如果想在 img 的 src 属性里使用，只需要在前面加上 base64 的前缀即可：
```js
// js
const srcValue = "data:image/png;base64,"+base64ImageString

// html
<img :src="srcValue" />
```

最终效果：

![](./array-buffer-img.png)

![](./pic.png)
